Figures  are  illustrative  and  based  on  recent  company  disclosures  and  public  
reports.
 
 
1.  Iron  &  Steel  
India  is  now  the  world’s  second-largest  steel  producer,  and  domestic  firms  like  Tata  Steel,  
JSW
 
Steel,
 
and
 
SAIL
 
dominate
 
the
 
industry.
 
 
Major  players-  FY  turnover/  production  (approx.)  
Company  FY  Turnover  (₹,  approx.)  
Crude/  Saleable  Steel  (Mt,  approx.)  
JSW  Steel  ₹1,68,800  crore  Crude  ~27.8  Mt;  Saleable  ~26.5  Mt  
Tata  Steel  (group)  ₹1,40,900  crore  Crude  ~20.1  Mt  (group)  
SAIL  ₹1,04,500  crore  Integrated  domestic  production  (Mt  scale)  
Jindal  Steel  &  Power  (JSPL)  
₹49,800  crore  Integrated  production  (several  Mt)  
Primary  processes  in  India  
●  BF–BOF  (Blast  Furnace  →  Basic  Oxygen  Furnace):  dominant  for  large  integrated  
steel
 
plants
 
producing
 
hot
 
metal
 
using
 
iron
 
ore
 
and
 
coking
 
coal.
 
 ●  DRI–EAF  (Direct  Reduced  Iron  →  Electric  Arc  Furnace):  growing  rapidly,  used  
with
 
non-coking
 
coal
 
or
 
natural
 
gas
 
+
 
EAFs
 
(scrap
 
+
 
DRI
 
feed).
 
Preferred
 
for
 
flexibility
 
and
 
lower
 
carbon
 
intensity
 
when
 
coupled
 
with
 
renewable
 
power.
 
 
Raw  materials  &  sources  
●  Iron  ore:  captive  mines  &  domestic  supply  (Odisha,  Jharkhand,  Chhattisgarh,  Goa);  
imports
 
when
 
needed.
 
 ●  Coking  coal:  limited  domestic  supply;  significant  imports  (Australia,  Indonesia).  
 ●  Scrap:  expanding  domestic  recycling  feed  for  EAFs.  
 
Position  
●  India  is  among  the  world’s  top  steel  producers.  Companies  such  as  JSW  and  Tata  
are
 
the
 
largest
 
private
 
producers
 
domestically
 
and
 
are
 
scaling
 
globally.
 
India’s
 
combined
 
national
 
production
 
places
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
2–3
 
globally;
 
however,
 
the
 
largest
 
global
 
single
 
companies
 
(e.g.,
 
China-based
 
groups,
 
ArcelorMittal)
 
still
 
exceed
 
individual
 
Indian
 
producers
 
in
 
absolute
 
output.
 
 
 
2.  Copper  
Major  players   
Company/  Group  FY  Turnover(₹)  Key  notes  (capacity/  production)  
Hindustan  Copper  Ltd  (HCL)  
 ₹1,686  crore  Government  miner  -  MIC  (metal-in-concentrate)  production  in  the  tens  of  kt  range  annually  (domestic  mining-focused).  
Vedanta/  Sterlite  (historical)  
 Historically  operated  the  large  Thoothukudi  smelter  (hundreds  of  ktpa  smelter  capacity);  operations  have  experienced  regulatory/operational  pauses  in  the  past.  
Kutch  Copper  (Adani/  Mundra  project)  
_  Large  greenfield  smelter/  refinery  capacity  projects  announced,  aiming  to  grow  domestic  refined-copper  production  substantially.  
Primary  processes  in  India  
●  Mining  →  Crushing  →  Concentration  (flotation)  →  Smelting  →  Converting  →  Electrolytic  refining.  Pyrometallurgical  smelting  followed  by  electrolytic  refining  to  produce  cathode-grade  copper  is  the  standard  route.  Recycling  and  secondary  refining  also  contribute.   
Raw  materials  &  sources  
●  Domestic  copper  ore/  concentrates:  limited  relative  to  demand;  major  mines  operated  by  HCL  and  smaller  producers.   ●  Imports:  India  imports  copper  concentrates  and  refined  cathodes  to  meet  industrial  demand;  recent  large  smelter  projects  aim  to  reduce  import  dependence.   
Position  
●  India’s  current  refined-copper  production  is  smaller  than  domestic  demand;  ongoing  capacity  expansions  are  raising  domestic  self-sufficiency.  On  a  global  scale,  India  accounts  for  a  small  share  of  refined  copper  production  compared  to  international  majors.   
 
3.  Zinc  
Major  players  
Company  FY  turnover  (₹)  Notes  (production)  
Hindustan  Zinc  Ltd  (HZL,  Vedanta)  
₹28,932  crore  India’s  leading  zinc  producer-  refined  zinc  output  in  the  ~1  Mt  range  (annual  refined  output  reported  around  ~1,000  kt  in  recent  strong  years).  Captive  mines  and  integrated  smelter/refinery  assets.  
Primary  processes  
●  Mining  →  Concentration  →  Smelting/Refining  (Roast–Leach–Electrowinning  or  pyrometallurgical  routes  as  applicable).  HZL  uses  integrated  processing  routes  between  its  mines  and  refineries.   
Raw  materials  &  sources  
●  Zinc  ore/  concentrates:  captive  mines  (Rajasthan  and  other  deposits)  and  sourced  concentrates.  Large  domestic  reserves  supply  primary  feedstock  for  HZL.   
Position  
●  HZL  dominates  domestic  refined-zinc  production  and  is  a  significant  mid-sized  global  zinc  producer  by  refined  volume.   
 
4.  Aluminium  
Major  players   
Company  FY  Turnover  (₹)  Notes  (production  &  assets)  
Hindalco  Industries  (Aditya  Birla)  
₹2,15,900  crore  (consolidated  incl.  Novelis)  
Large  producer;  Novelis  (rolled  products)  gives  substantial  global  presence  and  recycling  capability.  
NALCO  (National  Aluminium  Company)  
₹13,100  crore  (approx.)  
Major  public-sector  producer;  large  bauxite  excavation  and  alumina  refinery  outputs;  integrated  captive  resources.  
Vedanta  (BALCO,  etc.)  
_  Large  private-sector  aluminium  assets  and  smelters.  
Primary  processes  
●  Bauxite  mining  →  Bayer  process  (refining)  →  Hall–Héroult  electrolytic  smelting.  Captive  power  is  critical  for  competitive  smelting.   
Raw  materials  &  sources  
●  Bauxite:  domestic  deposits  (Odisha,  Chhattisgarh,  Maharashtra,  Gujarat).  Many  large  producers  operate  captive  bauxite  mines.   ●  Power:  Smelting  is  electricity-intensive  -  captive  thermal  power  or  access  to  low-cost  grid/renewable  power  is  strategically  critical.   
Position  
●  Hindalco  (with  Novelis)  ranks  as  India’s  largest  aluminium  value-chain  group  and  is  globally  significant  (Novelis  being  a  world  leader  in  rolled  aluminium).  NALCO  is  a  leading  government-owned  integrated  producer.  India  is  a  major  aluminium  producer  globally,  but  behind  China  in  absolute  smelting  volumes.   
 
Cross-cutting  trends  &  observations  
1.  Vertical  integration  &  captive  resources  -  Large  groups  secure  upstream  feedstock  (mines)  and  captive  power  to  reduce  supply  risk  and  costs.   2.  Energy  &  decarbonisation  pressure  -  Industry  movement  toward  lower-carbon  routes:  DRI–EAF  in  steel,  higher  recycling  rates  (aluminium  &  steel),  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewables.   3.  Import  substitution  -  New  smelters  and  refineries  (e.g.,  copper)  are  being  added  to  reduce  dependence  on  imports  for  refined  metals.
