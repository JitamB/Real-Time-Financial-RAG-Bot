Pathway Problem Statement:
About Pathway
Pathway is shaking the foundations of AI by introducing the world’s first post-transformer model that
adapts and thinks just like humans.
BDH Architecture paper on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.26507
The breakthrough architecture outperforms Transformer and provides the enterprise with full
visibility into how the model works. Combining the foundational model with the fastest data
processing engine on the market (the framework at your disposal for this year’s inter IIT), Pathway
enables enterprises to move beyond incremental optimization and toward truly contextualized,
experience-driven intelligence. We are trusted by organizations such as NATO, La Poste, and Formula
1 racing teams.
Pathway is led by co-founder & CEO Zuzanna Stamirowska, a complexity scientist who created a team
consisting of AI pioneers, including CTO Jan Chorowski who was the first person to apply Attention to
speech and worked with Nobel laureate Geoff Hinton at Google Brain, as well as CSO Adrian
Kosowski, a leading computer scientist and quantum physicist who obtained his PhD at the age of 20
& co-founded SPOJ – one of the earliest popular competitive programming platforms. The company is
backed by leading investors and advisors, including Lukasz Kaiser, co-author of the Transformer (“the
T” in ChatGPT) and a key researcher behind OpenAI’s reasoning models.
Pathway is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has offices in Paris and Wrocław, and hires
exceptional talent remotely as well.

The Pathway Framework
The Pathway framework is a Python data processing framework designed for analytics and AI
pipelines over data streams. It is the ideal solution for real-time processing use cases such as
streaming ETL or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for unstructured, changing data.
Key Components of this definition:
1. Python Framework: Written in Rust for speed and efficiency, Pathway is usable via Python,
making it powerful yet simple to use with just Python know-how.
2. Data Processing: The Pathway framework excels at processing large-scale, real-time data and
is recognized as the world’s fastest data processing engine. As a developer, you can use it for
tasks like performing JOINS on incoming data streams (real-time data flow) or updating
vector/hybrid indexes in real time. These are just simple examples—its potential goes much
further.
3. AI Pipelines Over Data Streams: The Pathway framework helps AI systems learn from
real-time data streams, enabling applications like sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, and
RAG pipelines that automatically adapt to incoming data.
Problem Statement:
Hackathon Challenge: The Dynamic RAG
Playground
Section 1: Introduction: The Dawn of Live AI
The Problem with Stale Knowledge
In the current landscape of artificial intelligence, many applications powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) are constrained by a fundamental limitation: their knowledge is static.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, while powerful, often rely on a knowledge base that
is a mere snapshot in time. This creates a "knowledge cutoff," where an AI assistant can become
instantly obsolete. Imagine a financial chatbot unaware of a market-moving announcement made
minutes ago, or a customer service bot providing information based on documentation that was
updated yesterday. In a world that operates in real-time, these delays are critical failures.
The Paradigm Shift to "Live AI"
A new paradigm is emerging to address this challenge: "Live AI." This represents a fundamental shift
from static, retrospective intelligence to dynamic systems that perceive, learn, and reason in
real-time. Live AI applications are perpetually synchronized with the latest version of reality,
processing information as it is created, modified, or deleted. This hackathon is an invitation to be at
the forefront of this transformation.
Introducing Pathway: The Engine for Live AI
The core technology for this challenge is Pathway, a data processing framework designed specifically
for building AI pipelines over live data streams. It allows developers to define complex AI workflows
that can process information incrementally, enabling extremely low-latency updates. Its unique
architecture unifies batch and streaming data, meaning the same code can be prototyped on static
files and then deployed to a live data stream, drastically reducing development complexity. This
challenge provides an opportunity to harness this powerful engine to build the next generation of
intelligent, real-time thinking applications.
Section 2: The Core Challenge: Build a Real-Time Thinking
Application
Formal Problem Statement
Your challenge is to design, build, and deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application
using the Pathway framework that connects to a dynamic, continuously updating data source. The
application's core function must be to provide answers that reflect the absolute latest state of the
source data, updating its knowledge base and potential responses in real-time as new information
arrives, is modified, or is deleted, without requiring manual restarts or batch re-indexing.
Key Requirement: Demonstrable Dynamism
The central evaluation criterion for this challenge is the "liveness" and dynamism of the application. A
successful project is not merely a functional RAG pipeline; it is a dynamic RAG pipeline that can prove
its ability to think in real-time. Participants must be able to clearly demonstrate that when a piece of
information in the source data is altered, the application's response to a relevant query changes
almost instantly to reflect that alteration.
Example Application Ideas (to inspire, not restrict)
To stimulate brainstorming and showcase the breadth of possibilities, here are several potential
application concepts. Teams are encouraged to pursue these or develop their own unique ideas 1:
● Live News Analyst: A chatbot that ingests articles from a real-time news API. It can answer
nuanced questions about breaking news stories, with its understanding evolving as new reports,
updates, and corrections are published.
● Real-Time Stock Analyst: An agent that connects to a stream of financial news or market data
feeds. It could answer queries like, "What is the latest market sentiment regarding Company X's
new product launch?" based on articles published seconds ago.
● Dynamic Documentation Helper: A question-answering bot for a software project that indexes
documentation from a collaborative source like a shared Google Drive or SharePoint folder. As
engineers update the documentation, the bot's answers become immediately accurate.
● Social Media Trend Tracker: An application that monitors a live stream of posts from a platform
like Reddit or another social network. It could summarize the latest public sentiment on a
specific topic or identify emerging trends.
● Live E-commerce Inventory Assistant: A RAG application that connects to a database of product
information and inventory levels. It could answer customer questions about product availability
and specifications, with its knowledge reflecting the exact current state of the inventory.
Section 3: Data Source Guidelines and Recommendations
Requirement for a Dynamic Source
A core requirement of this challenge is that all projects must connect to a data source that is
genuinely dynamic—one that changes over the course of the hackathon. While using a static dataset
is acceptable for initial development, the final submitted project must demonstrate its ability to
handle a live, evolving data stream.
Recommended Data Sources: Real-Time News APIs
To ensure all teams have access to a high-quality, continuous stream of text data, the use of a free
real-time news API is strongly recommended.2 These services provide a readily available source of
new and updated information, perfect for demonstrating the real-time capabilities of your
application.
Table 1: Comparison of Suggested Real-Time News APIs
The following table provides a summary of several news APIs that offer free tiers suitable for this
hackathon. Teams should review the terms of service for each and select the one that best fits their
project's needs.

Alternative Data Sources
Teams are highly encouraged to be creative and are free to use other dynamic data sources.
Pathway's robust connector ecosystem supports a wide variety of options.6 Some alternative ideas
include:
● Cloud Storage: Use native connectors for Google Drive, SharePoint, or S3 to monitor a folder for
new or modified documents.8
● Streaming Platforms: Connect to a Kafka topic or an MQTT broker to process events from a
message queue.6
● Databases: Use a connector to a database like PostgreSQL and leverage Change Data Capture
(CDC) to stream table updates in real-time.7
● Custom Python Sources: Any data source accessible via a Python library can be turned into a live
Pathway table, offering limitless possibilities.6
Section 4: Judging Criteria and Weighting
Overview
Projects will be evaluated by a panel of judges based on a video pitch and a review of the submitted
code repository. The criteria are specifically designed and weighted to reward projects that deeply
embrace and successfully demonstrate the core concept of "Live AI".9
Criterion 1: Real-Time Capability & Dynamism (35%)
● Description: This is the most critical criterion. How effectively does the application process and
react to new or updated data in real-time? Can the team clearly demonstrate that a change in
the data source is immediately reflected in the application's output without manual
intervention?
● What Judges Will Look For: A convincing live or video demonstration of the end-to-end dynamic
behavior. Evidence of low latency between a data event and the knowledge base update. A
robust architecture that can handle a continuous stream of data.
Criterion 2: Technical Implementation & Elegance (30%)
● Description: How well is the Pathway framework utilized? Is the code clean, well-structured,
efficient, and well-documented? Does the system architecture demonstrate a clear
understanding of stream processing principles?
● What Judges Will Look For: Correct and idiomatic use of the Pathway API. A clean, readable
codebase with a clear separation of concerns. A high-quality README.md file that explains the
architecture and provides clear setup instructions.
Criterion 3: Innovation & User Experience (20%)
● Description: How creative, unique, and compelling is the application's concept and execution?
How intuitive and effective is the user interface? Does the project solve a real-world problem in
a novel way? 9
● What Judges Will Look For: A creative use case that goes beyond a generic question-answering
bot. A functional and clean user interface (a well-designed command-line interface or REST API is
sufficient). Evidence of thoughtful prompt engineering.
Criterion 4: Impact & Feasibility (15%)
● Description: What is the potential real-world impact of this application? Is there a clear path
from this prototype to a production-ready system? Has the team considered the business, social,
or practical value of their solution? 9
● What Judges Will Look For: A clear articulation of the problem being solved. A discussion of
potential scalability, commercial applications, or social benefits. A polished presentation that
effectively communicates the project's value.
Section 5: Submission Requirements and Deliverables
To be eligible for judging, all teams must submit the following items by the specified deadline.
● Code Repository: A link to a public repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab containing all
source code and necessary project files.
● Comprehensive README.md: The repository's README.md file is a critical document. It must
contain:
○ The project title and a concise description of the application.
○ A clear explanation of the application's architecture.
○ Detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the environment, configure API keys,
and run the project. This is essential for judges to verify functionality.10
● Video Demonstration (Maximum 3 minutes): A short, compelling video that serves as the
primary pitch for the project. The video must include:
○ A brief introduction of the team and the problem they chose to solve.
○ A clear demonstration of the application in action.
○ A dedicated segment that explicitly proves the real-time functionality. For example,
showing a new document being added to a monitored folder and then immediately asking
the application a question that it can only answer using the information from that new data
source.
● Submission Deadline: All materials must be submitted via the official hackathon platform by
deadline (would be informed via known platforms). Late submissions will not be accepted.
By combining Pathway’s core abstractions i.e. connectors, tables, transformations, and the powerful
Rust-based incremental engine) with modern AI elements such as deterministic models, incremental
training, and agent orchestration, you will demonstrate what real-time AI looks like in practice.
